# Prework Study Guide for UT Austin Webpage

## Description

This is a project I worked on over the course of about a week, gradually learning HTML, CSS, and JS for the first time. I also learned how to practice version control via GitHub and creating feature branches whilst working independently of the main branch for each phase. Although it may appear simple, there has been a lot of time and a few headaches along the way figuring different aspects of each of the languages, and I feel that i've learned a lot a long the way. This page was intended to be used by UT bootcamp students and can be utilized to randomly generate a topic amongst those stated to study, as opposed to choosing one yourself. Enjoy!
